                If you think Southern California is all shopping malls, freeways and theme parks ... then why don't you take a hike with us!

            <div class="content">
                <p>The Hundred Peaks Section is section of the Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club dedicated to hiking peaks in Southern California. We maintain a list of 281 worthy peaks in this region. Believe it or not, Southern California has some of the most endearing landscapes in the United States, and we want to see it all.</p>
                <p>Outings are held several times per week, usually to one or more of the peaks on the list. Everyone, including non-members, are welcome to join these outings, and all outings are free unless a fee is otherwise disclosed in the outing description. Some of our hikes are easy, some are moderate, and some are very difficult. Our hikes can be lots of fun and a great opportunity to meet other fellow hikers.</p>
                <p>Besides hiking, we have periodic celebrations, picnics, parties, rendezvouses ... and our bimonthly newsletter (called <i>The Lookout</i>). All are are geared toward helping both experienced and beginner hikers hike by providing needed information. Fellow hikers share their adventures as they explore our mountains and obtain our peaks.
                </p>
                <p>If you have climbed 25 peaks on our list, we encourage you to join the section as a member. You will receive the latest bimonthly copy of
                    <i>The Lookout</i>, and you will be contributing to our illustrious organization, founded by naturalist Weldon Heald in 1946.
                </p>

                <p>Note that while leaders try to accomodate as many participants as possible on their hikes, there are sometimes restrictions to ensure that each participant for each outing has the necessary skills to complete the hike.</p>
                <p>Besides hiking and leading hikes, lots of people volunteer to help the Section. Consider joining their ranks.</p>
                <p>We would like to welcome you to our HPS family ... please join us as we hike and explore our wonderful mountain ranges.</p>
